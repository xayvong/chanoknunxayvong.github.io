								<p>Hi, my name is Chanoknun Xayvong, but I go by Cody for short. I started my education for software technology sometime in 2015 and have been going to school on and off. I opened a restaurant in 2017 called New Sun and ran a successful restaurant for almost 5 years. I tried to continue my schooling, but eventually the restaurant became too busy and I had to focus my efforts there. After almost 5 years of running a successful restaurant, I decided that this isn't what I wanted to do with my life and sold my business to finish my education in Software Technology.</p>
								<p>I've always been passionate about technology and even dreamed of creating my own games when I was a child. This passion lead me to pursure an education in Software Technology so that I could achieve that goal. I've realized throughout my life that passion about something not only helps you achieve growth, but it also gives you a reason to strive to improve and better yourself. I'm passionate about martial arts, and I'm a 4th degree blackbelt in Taekwondo that has been practicing and teaching it for 15+ years now. I'm also passionate about music and have been creating and producing music for the same amount of time. The skills I have aquired through my hobbies directly influence my ability to solve problems and learn new things, which I will carry with me for any goals I try to achieve and pursue.</p>
